# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
   V. Isualize has requested Omar and I to analyze the Uber ride share data. Breaking it out by the city types of Urban, Suburban and Rural types.
   We have create a summary of the data and also a graph to represent our findings.
   
   
## Results

   ### Summary Table
   
   * Total Ridership. Urban areas had the most ridership followed by Suburban and then Rural
   * Total Drivers had a strong correlation to total riders. With Urban areas having the most drivers again followed by Suburban and then Rural.
   * Total Fares also has the strong correlation with Total riders. The more Riders the more fares. Urban Areas had the most Fares followed by Suburban then Rural.
   * The Average Fare per Ride. Rural Areas had the highest average fair followed by Suburban then Urban. We can assume this is based on the driving distances 
     between riders in Rural areas and those in Suburban and Urban. Rural passengers have longer to go to get to their destinations than Suburban passengers and 
     Suburban passangers have longer distances than their Urban counterparts.
   * The Average Fare per Driver. It was highest in Rural followed by Suburban then Urban. Our assumption is that based on the greater distances traveled and the 
      lower number of drivers. This has pushed the average fare per driver higher.

   ### Graph 
   
   We graphed our total fares out by city type over the last few months.
   
   * The graph quickly show that the majority of our sales is in our urban centers.
   * Rural areas make up a much small segment of our total sales.
   * We don't have enough data to determine any seasonality of our sales.

## Summary
   Our recommendations are as follows.
   
   * More Analysis of wait times for riders or missed rides: based on the Average fare per rider in the Urban setting. Are we over positioned in terms of drivers? More      analysis would need to be done. Similar concerns with the rural market. the total fares are low but is this because of the total riders of just 125 or is it            because we only had 78 drives, leaving other potentional customers without rides.
   * Additional follow up to gauge the seasonality of our data. We graphed our data for a few months. A more in depth look at prior years data would help us plan for 
     where our demand is during the year. Holidays for example?
   * Our final suggestion is to look at the data at more granual level, at the city level. We feel there may be some cities that skew our data within the city types we 
     we selected.
